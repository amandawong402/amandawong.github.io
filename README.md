I am an avid runner, traveller, hiker, and painter. 

In my day to day downtime, you can find me on Google Maps planning new trip itineraries, relentently going on peaceful walks around the neighborhood to reach my 15k steps/day, Googling puppies for adoption, re-watching 49er plays on Youtube, and savoring my homemade matcha lattes with honey while sitting outside.
